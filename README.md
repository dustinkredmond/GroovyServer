GroovyServer lets you run and schedule Apache Groovy &copy; code from a simple web interface. GroovyServer provides scheduling capabilities, customizable logging, multiple users, and a simple API to provide basic functionalities such as reporting and notification.

GroovyServer is distributed as a WAR file suitable for deployment to your application server. It is offered in two varieties through [our website], a standalone application making use of it's own database, or a full-featured version that allows you to use your own RDBMS. We support and maintain both versions, but the full-featured version with separate RDBMS is likely to be the first to receive new features. 

Builds are regularly executed from the repository via our continous integration system to ensure that anyone can build GroovyServer at any time. Our distribution builds on [our website] are generated directly from our GitHub repository.
