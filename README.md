### Run Apache Groovy from a web interface!

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer)

GroovyServer lets you run and schedule Apache Groovy &copy; code from a simple web interface. GroovyServer provides scheduling capabilities, customizable logging, multiple users, and a simple API to provide basic functionalities such as reporting and notification.

GroovyServer is distributed as a WAR file suitable for deployment to your application server. It is offered in two varieties through [our website], a standalone application making use of it's own database, or a full-featured version that allows you to use your own RDBMS.

We also offer a [demo] version that we host, albeit most of the functionality is disabled for security reasons. We want you to run Groovy on ***your server***, not ours. :)

Builds are regularly executed from the repository via our continous integration system to ensure that anyone can build GroovyServer at any time. Our distribution builds on [our website] are generated directly from our GitHub repository.

Feel free to fork us or submit a pull request. We love your input!
