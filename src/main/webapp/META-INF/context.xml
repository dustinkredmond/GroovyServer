    <!-- Used for configuring GroovyServer's database connections
      Connections are negotiated by the org.gserve.api.persistence.Database
      class. Any customizability of GroovyServer's database connection functionality
      should be modified there, and the below Resource should be modified as appropriate.

      GroovyServer is tested with MariaDB and MySQL, other databases were not taken into account
      when designing the software, and as such could cause unintended results or may not function
      entirely..
